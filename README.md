The data wrangling and analysis process can be long and complex. This is especially true if one is not familiar with the tools necessary to accomplish such tasks. Therefore, I decided to develop this notebook to simplify and make the process easier. No prior programming experience is required.

Through this notebook you have the ability to drop columns/rows, alter the headers, geocode, explore column statistics, filter the data set, and visualize.

This notebook was developed using primarily Pandas and Holoviz. Please note that performance issues may occur if working with large data sets as this is hosted on the cloud. To launch the notebook, simply click the 'launch binder' badge above. Enjoy!
